              For the person who nurtured the club when it was a small bundle of some curious students and established it as a close-knit community that has been growing larger as everyday passes, a
              simple ‘thank you’ will never be able to express our gratitude for all the things you have done for STAC. You have been there for us not just as a helpful senior or caring mentor but
              also as our true friend and well-wisher. We have learnt a lot from you and we know wherever you go, you will be genuinely happy whenever any of us will achieve something and will always
              be the person we can share our problems with. We look back to the day when you introduced this amazing club to us and cherish all the beautiful memories we have spent with you, be it the
              night outs, the fun telescope sessions, the exciting competitions, the canteen treats, the late night movies, the fun trips and parties and many more such memories that will always bring
              a smile on our faces. You are a gem of a person and will always be a source of motivation and inspiration for us. The club is indebted to you for your dedication and hard work forever
              and we look forward to the day we’ll meet again, talk our hearts out and laugh at all the lame jokes we can think of, not to forget your iconic dance moves! Wish you good luck in all
              your future endeavours, Shreyas. Keep making us proud with all your achievements!<br>Until we meet again! :)

              Bakraaaaa!<br>We're fortunate to say that you were one of the people who were fundamental in shaping STAC and the family in the way it is today. All of the unseen hard work that you put
              in, led the club from a handful of students to one of the most prominent student communities in Mandi (all the while also handling Darsheel Safari as your co-coordi- kaise kar liya??
              xD)<br>All jokes aside, you're truly someone we look up to. You've always been there for the club whenever we needed you despite all your other responsibilities. With your wit, humour
              and humility, you're also one of the coolest seniors to hang out with. So it's no surprise that many of our fondest memories of STAC are with you, from telescope sessions and laser
              pointers to singing and astrophotography at Diana Park. We hope we all get to meet again soon and make some more memories.<br>Thank you for everything you've done for the club, and the
              values that you've taught us with everything you've accomplished. I (along with many others I'm sure) aspire to someday have a signature photo pose as iconic as yours xD<br>Wish you the
              best of luck for the future! Aur yaad rakhna, aapki party abhi bhi pending hai!

              “How lucky we are to have known you all that makes saying goodbye so hard.” Thanks a lot, Navneet for all those amazing photographs during the trips and the parties. You are among the
              seniors upon which we can rely for almost anything. You have amazing skills and you will always be the person we look upto for that. Your passion about the things you are interested in,
              inspires us to do great things in life. We feel really sad that we could not give you the farewell you deserved but, we will miss you and always cherish the memories we have with you.
              While we really admire you for your skills and talents and all that you have done for the club and the institute as well, you have also set an example of a true and caring friend. You
              are that one person we can go to at any point of time when we feel low or dejected and we know that you will listen to us and stick to us through thick and thin. We hope you had a great
              time at STAC, and will continue to be a part of the family and keep delighting us with awesome astrophotographs. We all wish you a great future ahead Navneet!

              With a heavy heart , we are writing to bid a good bye to one of the best persons STAC could have. Surely, you are not going out of our family, you are just waving off from its eyes. STAC
              carries your soul, mind and dedication that you gave to this club, the way you cherished the club with those physics brainstorming sessions, when the &#39;Einstein of IIT Mandi&#39; used
              to teach us the lessons of relativity, the one who made physics phenomenally explorable. Looking back at all the interactions we had with you, it only fills our hearts with pleasure and
              happiness that we got a chance to be a part of the club that has amazing seniors like you. You will always be a person we all will look up to and be proud of. We admire you for your
              dedication, sweetness and humility. Your hard work and dedication is clearly reflected in the interesting STAC sessions that you have taken when you tirelessly explained us things in
              great detail so we could understand. We still remember the times when you would put all your thoughts on the board to make us relate with the different concepts of physics and astronomy
              and clarify all our doubts no matter how much time it would take. At the same time, we cannot deny the fact that you are utterly humorous in a very unique way which we love about you. We
              feel really sad that we could not give you the farewell you deserved but, we will miss you and always cherish the memories we have with you. We hope you had a great time at STAC, and
              will continue to be a part of the fam. Wishing you joy and happiness as you begin a new chapter in your life!

              you have been one of such people. Thank you, Shishir, for being with STAC since the very beginning. You are hands down one of the coolest seniors we ever had. Hanging out with you was an
              absolute pleasure. Your tenacity to participate and lead in so many clubs was admirable, something we all wished we could do too. You are one of the most genuine, fun and caring persons
              we ever had the chance to meet. You have been a very chilled out and approachable person and a good friend to all. We remember how your name would always be there among the quiz winners
              and all the discussions we used to have with you. You were also one of the first people to write a blog for STAC. It is still read by us and has been setting a great example for fellow
              writers. Your extraordinary knowledge won many competitions and many hearts and you have been a constant role model and aspiration to all.<br>We hope we can stay in touch in the future

              We were introduced to you right from your First year. Your engagement and your love for physics is very inspiring. We all appreciate you for the efforts that you have put in. You would
              come from the south campus to North even for a meeting of 30 minutes and that too late at night. We will always admire you for your humility and sweetness. Whenever we would meet you,
              you always greeted us with a warm smile that would leave an impact. To describe you I would say, you are our linking bridge between both the campuses and people whom we couldn't reach
              easily. You always had the sense of sharing knowledge with you. And we all got benefited by that as a community. With all those interactions that we had, we are honoured to have you as
              our senior. Thank you so much for sharing knowledge with us, spending time with us and giving us a golden opportunity to know how pure a soul you are. Just be the same as you are now!!!

              It feels like not too long ago when we were attending your sessions and exchanging cosmological ideas. We remember amazing night-outs with you, observing distant worlds through the
              telescope. We cherish post-event parties, enlightening conversations with you, and activities organized by you to intrigue us for astronomy. It's not just about the club. It feels like a
              family. We shall always be thankful for the things we learned from you. STAC saw a lot of growth and accomplishments under your mentorship. You established a legacy for us that we strive
              to grow. From the bottom of our hearts, we say GoodBye to you. We will miss you until we meet again!
